Breaking any other branch will kill the tree. In TFC, when you place a seedling of a fruit tree, the seedling is placed, not the trunk of the fruit tree. Over time, the seedling will form the trunk of the fruit tree and become a fruit tree. At TFC, you can also place fruit tree seedlings in flower pots.
