You're not my friend, you're my friend
I wish I had some pizza
Save me, I'm a prisoner
Drink some Minecraft
Oh, f**k it, I'm out of here
Are you waiting for me to say genius phrases?
Happy diarrhea day!
I'm hungry...
I can see you
*Ominous laughter*
And I thought I was the one with the bad jokes
If you can do something, don't do it for free
May the Force be with you
You're gonna need a bigger boat
I'll be back
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer
Behold the beauty!
I see you are a connoisseur of art
Don't look at me! I'm naked!
Don't walk away from me...
Hello, Piglin
To you I am but text
I want a house made of mud
I conjure love for you
A little chicken waiting for you
Let me touch...
