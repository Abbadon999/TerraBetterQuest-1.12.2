# List of changes
## Version 0.4.0 - 29.06.2022
[Heavy]
### Modpack fixes
* Almost completely cut out circles of stone ruins(Stonehenge), with vessels (Since the vessels can sometimes be found too much "next-level" things, and thus in the early stages to greatly accelerate the progress of development).
* Fixed backpack (The backpack had an abnormal carrying weight. You could literally put everything you see in it and thus ignore the weight of everything in the backpack. Also, the way of infinitely putting crates into the backpack and back into the crate again was cut).
* Slightly corrected the loading screen.
* Main menu has been corrected for the new version of mod.
